🔁 Single-Area OSPF Configuration Across 3 Routers
This project demonstrates the configuration of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as a dynamic routing protocol within a single-area topology involving three routers. It enables automatic route exchange and efficient path determination across all connected networks.

📘 Project Summary
Configured OSPF in a single area (Area 0) across three routers.

Assigned unique router IDs for proper OSPF operation.

Enabled OSPF on all active interfaces between the routers.

Ensured full adjacency between all routers and dynamic route learning.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS via GNS3

OSPF

🔧 How It Works
All routers are placed in OSPF Area 0 (the backbone area).

Interfaces between routers are configured with IP addresses and enabled under the OSPF process.

OSPF automatically establishes neighbor adjacencies and exchanges routing updates.

Routing tables are dynamically updated, eliminating the need for static routes.

✅ Verification
Use show ip ospf neighbor to verify that all routers form adjacencies.

Use show ip route ospf to confirm that all routes are properly learned.

Use ping or traceroute between networks connected to different routers to verify full end-to-end connectivity.
