🔁 Dynamic Routing with VLSM Across 5 Offices
This project sets up a network of five offices using dynamic routing protocols combined with Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) for efficient IP address allocation based on each office's host requirements.


📘 Project Summary
Configured dynamic routing (EIGRP) across 5 interconnected offices.

Utilized VLSM to accurately assign subnet sizes based on the number of hosts required in each branch.

Ensured full connectivity between all offices with automatic route propagation.


⚙️ Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3 / Real Routers

IPv4 addressing with VLSM

Dynamic Routing Protocol (e.g., OSPF, RIP, or EIGRP)

Router CLI configuration


🔧 How It Works
Routing Configuration: A dynamic routing protocol is configured on all routers to share network routes automatically.

Verification: Connectivity tested via ping and traceroute across all devices and subnets.
