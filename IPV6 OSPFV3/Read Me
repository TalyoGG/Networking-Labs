🔁 IPv6 Dynamic Routing Across 3 Routers
This project demonstrates the configuration of a dynamic IPv6 routing protocol across a 3-router topology,
enabling efficient and automated route exchange using IPv6 addressing.

📘 Project Summary
Configured IPv6 addressing on all router interfaces.

Implemented a dynamic routing protocol (OSPFv3) across 3 routers.

Enabled automatic route learning and advertisement between routers to simplify network scalability and management.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS via GNS3

IPv6 addressing

OSPFv3

ICMPv6 for connectivity testing

🔧 How It Works
All routers are configured with global unicast IPv6 addresses on their interfaces.

A dynamic routing protocol (OSPFv3) is enabled on each router.

Routers exchange IPv6 routes automatically, eliminating the need for manual static routing.

Devices connected to each router are able to communicate over IPv6 without manual route configuration.

✅ Verification
Use ping ipv6 between end devices to confirm full connectivity.
