🌐 IPv6 Default Static Routing Across 3 Routers
This project demonstrates the configuration of IPv6 default static routing across a simple network topology involving three interconnected routers, using IPv6 global unicast and link-local addresses to enable full IPv6 routing.

📘 Project Summary
Configured IPv6 addressing on all interfaces across 3 routers.

Set up default static routes (::/0) to control traffic flow toward the Main Router (R2).

Enabled end-to-end IPv6 connectivity between devices on different segments.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS GNS3

IPv6 addressing and routing

Static routing with IPv6

ICMPv6 for testing connectivity

🔧 How It Works
Router2: Acts as the main gateway to each of of the R1 and R2 network

Router1 and Router2: Internal routers with default routes pointing to Router1.

Static routes (::/0) are configured on Router2 and Router3 to send all traffic to Router1 using its IPv6 address as the next hop.

✅ Verification
Use the ping and traceroute (or traceroute ipv6) commands to confirm connectivity.

Validate that R1 Network traffic is routed through the R2 Router.

Test with ICMPv6 or end device communication across subnets.
