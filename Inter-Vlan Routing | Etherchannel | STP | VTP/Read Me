Hierarchical Network Design with HSRP, EtherChannel, VTP, STP & Inter-VLAN Routing
This project implements a three-layer hierarchical network architecture using core, distribution, and access layers, featuring technologies like HSRP, LACP EtherChannel, VTP, STP, port security, dynamic routing, and inter-VLAN routing to build a redundant, scalable, and secure LAN infrastructure.

📘 Project Summary
Designed a hierarchical network consisting of:

🧠 Core Layer: 1 Router

🛡️ Distribution Layer: 2 Layer 3 switches (L3 Switch 1 – Main, L3 Switch 2 – Backup)

💡 Access Layer: 2 Access Switches

Key configurations:

✅ HSRP between both distribution switches (L3 Switches) for default gateway redundancy

🔗 EtherChannel (LACP) on all inter-switch links

🏷️ VTP (Server/Client) on switches for centralized VLAN propagation

🛑 STP with L3 Switch 1 as the primary root bridge and L3 Switch 2 as secondary

🔐 Port Security on all access layer interfaces

🔄 Dynamic routing protocol between Core Router (R1) and Remote Router (R2) connecting to the remote server

🔁 Inter-VLAN Routing enabled on Layer 3 switches

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS via Packet Tracer

Layer 3 Switching

HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)

EtherChannel (LACP)

VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)

Port Security

Inter-VLAN Routing

IPv4 & Dynamic Routing (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)

🔧 How It Works
🔄 Redundancy
HSRP provides gateway failover at the distribution layer.

L3 Switch 1 is the Active HSRP device (primary), and L3 Switch 2 acts as Standby.

🔗 Link Aggregation
LACP-based EtherChannel groups are configured on all links between switches and between switches and the router.

Enhances bandwidth and provides link redundancy.

🧵 VLAN Management
VTP Server is configured on L3 Switch 1 to manage and propagate VLANs.

Access switches and L3 Switch 2 act as VTP clients.

🧬 STP Topology
L3 Switch 1 is manually set as the primary root bridge for all VLANs.

L3 Switch 2 is set as the secondary root to take over if needed.

🔐 Security
Port security is enforced on access interfaces to prevent unauthorized device access.

🌍 Routing
Dynamic routing protocol (OSPF) is configured between R1 (Core) and R2 (Remote) for external connectivity.

Inter-VLAN routing is implemented on L3 switches to enable host communication across VLANs.

✅ Verification Tests
1️⃣ EtherChannel Test (LACP)
Perform a continuous ping from any local host to the remote server.

Shut down one physical link in the EtherChannel group.

Expected result: Ping should not be interrupted, proving successful LACP configuration.

2️⃣ HSRP Failover Test
Perform a continuous ping from a host to the gateway or server.

Shut down all active interfaces of the Main L3 Switch.

Expected result: Traffic should failover to the Backup L3 Switch, and connectivity remains uninterrupted.

3️⃣ Inter-VLAN Routing Test
Ping between hosts located in different VLANs.

Expected result: Hosts should successfully communicate, verifying inter-VLAN routing.
