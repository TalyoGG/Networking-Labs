🌐 IPv6 Static Routing Across 3 Routers
This project demonstrates the configuration of IPv6 static routing across a simple network topology involving three interconnected routers, using IPv6 global unicast and link-local addresses to enable full IPv6 routing.

📘 Project Summary
Configured IPv6 addressing on all interfaces across 3 routers.

Set up static routes (::/0) to control traffic flow toward the Main Router (R2).

Enabled end-to-end IPv6 connectivity between devices on different segments.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS GNS3

IPv6 addressing and routing

Static routing with IPv6

ICMPv6 for testing connectivity

🔧 How It Works
Router2: Acts as the main gateway to each of the R1 and R3 networks.

Router1 and Router3: Internal routers with static routes pointing to Router2.

Static routes (::/0) are configured on Router1 and Router3 to send all traffic to Router2 using its IPv6 address as the next hop.

✅ Verification
Use the ping and traceroute (or traceroute ipv6) commands to confirm connectivity.

Test with ICMPv6 or end device communication across subnets.
