🔐 GRE Tunnel VPN with OSPF over Public ISP
This project demonstrates the configuration of a GRE Tunnel VPN between two routers over a public ISP network, with OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) used to establish dynamic routing and neighbor adjacency over the tunnel.

📘 Project Summary
Configured a GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) tunnel between two routers across separate networks connected through an ISP.

Enabled OSPF as the dynamic routing protocol over the GRE tunnel.

Successfully formed OSPF neighbor adjacency across the tunnel.

Ensured seamless internal routing between LAN segments on both ends of the tunnel.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS (Packet Tracer)

GRE Tunnel

OSPF 

🔧 How It Works
GRE Tunnel was established between two routers using their respective public-facing interfaces.

OSPF was configured on the tunnel interface to allow route exchange and neighbor adjacency.

Devices on both sides of the tunnel are able to communicate dynamically through OSPF-learned routes over the GRE Tunnel

✅ Verification
Use ping between LAN devices on opposite ends to test connectivity.

Run show ip ospf neighbor to confirm that adjacency has been established.

Use show ip route to verify OSPF-learned routes via the GRE tunnel.
