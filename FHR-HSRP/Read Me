🔄 FHRP Configuration: HSRP for ISP Failover
This project showcases the implementation of First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) using Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) to ensure seamless failover between a primary and backup router toward the ISP.

📘 Project Summary
Implemented HSRP between two edge routers to provide gateway redundancy for internal network clients.

Ensured automatic failover to a backup router in the event of primary router failure.

Designed for improved network availability and business continuity at the edge of the network.

🔧 How It Works
Virtual IP Address (VIP) is configured as the default gateway for hosts.

Primary router actively forwards traffic (active role), while backup router remains on standby.

Upon failure of the active router, the standby router automatically takes over the VIP, maintaining uninterrupted connectivity to the ISP.

🛠️ Technologies Used
GNS3

HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)

Basic static routing toward the ISP

🔧 Verification

Perfomr continuous ping towards the FB Server terminated at the ISP, then shut all active interface of the Main Router. Traffic must fail over to the Back Up router.
