🔐 IPSec VPN Tunnel Over Public ISP Network
This project demonstrates the configuration of a secure IPSec VPN tunnel between two routers over a public ISP network, ensuring encrypted communication between two private networks across an untrusted medium.

📘 Project Summary
Configured an IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnel between two routers.

Established the tunnel over a simulated public ISP network.

Encrypted traffic between private LANs to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

Enabled secure communication between geographically separated networks.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS via Packet Tracer

IPSec (ISAKMP Phase 1 and Phase 2)

Pre-shared key authentication

ACLs to define interesting traffic

🔧 How It Works
Each router connects to the ISP via its public-facing interface.

IPSec Phase 1 establishes a secure IKE policy using a pre-shared key.

IPSec Phase 2 builds the IPSec tunnel to encrypt and decrypt traffic between LANs.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) define which traffic should be encrypted ("interesting traffic").

Hosts in both private networks can securely communicate as if they were in the same local network.

✅ Verification
Use ping between devices in the private LANs to confirm tunnel functionality.

Use show crypto isakmp sa and show crypto ipsec sa to verify tunnel establishment.

Confirm that traffic is being encrypted and decrypted across the tunnel.
