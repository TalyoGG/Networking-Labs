🌐 Multi-Area OSPF Network with DR/BDR Configuration
This project demonstrates the configuration of a Multi-Area OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) network, including Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) roles within the backbone area (Area 0) for improved routing efficiency and scalability.

📘 Project Summary
Implemented a multi-area OSPF network to optimize routing across distinct network segments.

Configured Area 0 as the backbone area.

Assigned Router R2 as the Designated Router (DR) and Router R3 as the Backup Designated Router (BDR) in Area 0.

Enabled OSPF on all interfaces connecting routers within their respective areas.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS via GNS3

Multi-Area OSPF

DR/BDR election

🔧 How It Works
R2 and R3 participate in OSPF Area 0, with R2 elected as DR and R3 as BDR based on priority or router ID.

Other routers in the area function as DROTHER routers.

Additional areas (e.g., Area 64, Area 65) are created and connected via Area Border Routers (ABRs).

Routing tables are automatically populated and updated using OSPF LSAs (Link-State Advertisements).

✅ Verification
Use show ip ospf neighbor to verify DR/BDR roles in Area 0.

Use show ip route ospf to confirm route propagation across areas.

Use ping and traceroute to test end-to-end connectivity between routers in different OSPF areas.

Shut down R2’s interface to test failover to R3 (BDR becomes DR).
