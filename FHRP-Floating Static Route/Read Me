🌐 Floating Static Route Configuration for Dual ISP Failover
This project demonstrates the implementation of floating static routes on a local router connected to two different ISPs to achieve automatic failover in case the primary ISP becomes unreachable.

📘 Project Summary
Configured a primary static route pointing to the main ISP.

Added a backup static route (with a higher administrative distance) pointing to a secondary ISP.

Ensured redundant internet connectivity using static route prioritization.

No need for dynamic routing protocols — simple and effective failover using administrative distance.

🔧 How It Works
The local router has two outbound paths:

ISP 1: Primary link

ISP 2: Secondary (backup) link

A floating static route is created with a higher administrative distance, so it remains inactive unless the primary route fails.

When the primary ISP link goes down, the router automatically switches to the backup route.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Cisco IOS CLI (via Packet Tracer, GNS3, or real hardware)

Floating static route with increased AD
